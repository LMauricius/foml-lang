# FOML
Functional Objective Minimal Language

## Objectives
FOML's goal is to be a easy to read, functional, context-aware configuration file format. It aims to be readable by an idiot in its core, with more dynamic features that don't stand out.

## Example
```
# This is a FOML configuration file

# todo
```
